# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As the bot is hosted by myself, and not to be downloaded by anyone else, it will always be running on the latest supported version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Should you run into a vulnerability, please send me an e-mail to mast.ergu.ymar.cel+thedoctor@gmail.com and include as much details as possible, and an example if possible.
